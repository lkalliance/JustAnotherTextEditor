## Description

Just Another Text Editor is a Progressive Web App that does one thing: it maintains a one-page notepad that will keep track of the user's input, even if they are offline.

As a PWA, Just Another Text Editor utilizes a service worker and IndexedDB storage to operate as a standalone app without a network connection.

## Installation Instructions

<img src="./client/src/images/JATE-screenshot.png" width="300" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />
The user can access Just Another Text Editor via a web browser [here on Heroku](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/). They can install it as a PWA via any browser with that technology enabled. Either utilize the browser's native application saver, or click the "Install" button in the main application window. They can now access the application via their browser's app menu or via whatever app icon that the browser creates.

Note: Just Another Text Editor relies on the use of service workers and IndexedDB to operate. Most modern browsers do support these technologies on both desktop and mobile, though most older versions do not.

## Usage Information

Interaction with Just Another Text Editor as either a website or a Progressive Web App is simple: just click to create a cursor location as one would in a text document, and type. The content is automatically saved when the user clicks anywhere except the text window, even if it is just to close the window.

## Credits

The original code for Just Another Text Editor was provided by the staff of the [University of Minnesota Full Stack Coding Boot Camp](https://ccaps.umn.edu/full-stack-web-development-certificate-coding-boot-camp). The PWA code is by Lee Klusky, with much guidance from the staff of the boot camp; documentation at [webpack.org](https://webpack.js.org) and Google's [Chrome Developers website](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/); and as is often the case, the accumulated wisdom of coders around the Web at places such as [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) and the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org).
